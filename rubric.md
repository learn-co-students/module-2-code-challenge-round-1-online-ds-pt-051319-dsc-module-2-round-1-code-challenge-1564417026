***
Point Value: 1.5

1 point(s): Correctly instantiate a `Pokemon` object

0.5 point(s): Correctly instantiate 3 `Pokemon` objects

***
Point Value: 2

1 point(s): Create an instance method appropriately within the class definition

1 point(s): Correctly use instance attributes `weight` and `height` to define the method


_Learning Goals: Define and access instance attributes. Define and call an instance method. Create instance methods that operate on instance attributes._


***
### Section 9: SQL and Relational Databases

Point Value: 5

0.5 point(s): Use `*` to retrieve all columns

0.5 point(s): Correctly use the `WHERE` clause

_Learning Goals: Retrieve all information from a SQL table. Write SQL queries to filter and order results. Retrieve a subset of records from a table using a WHERE clause._
***
0.5 point(s): Correctly select a subset of columns

0.25 point(s): Correctly use `ORDER BY` to sort results

0.25 point(s): Correctly use `DESC` to sort results in descending order

_Learning Goals: Order the results of your queries by using ORDER BY (ASC & DESC). Use Group By statements in SQL to apply aggregate functions like: COUNT, MAX, MIN, and SUM._
***
0.5 point(s): Correctly use a `JOIN` statement

0.5 point(s): Use the `JOIN` on the appropriate columns (`pokemon.type2` and `types.name`)

_Learning Goals: Query data using one-to-many and many-to-many joins._
***
0.25 point(s): Correctly use the `COUNT`, `MIN` and `MAX` aggregator

0.25 point(s): Correctly use the `JOIN` on `pokemon.type1` and `types.name`
